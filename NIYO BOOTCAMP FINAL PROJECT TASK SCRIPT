# Niyo-Data-Bootcamp
16 Week Data Analytics and Project Management Bootcamp.  
This was my Final Project from the bootcamp. The purpose of this project was to utilise the skills I gained over the 16 weeks to
complete a Data Analytics Project, which mirrors the steps I would take in a data analyst
or data science role. 
I was assessed on my ability to demonstate the techniques and methods covered in the SQL, Data Visualisation and Excel sessions.

The data I was provided with was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/.

Background:
Credit Card Customers: A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more
customers leaving their credit card services. This dataset consists of 10,000
customers mentioning their age, salary, marital_status, credit card limit, credit card
category, etc. There are nearly 18 features.
